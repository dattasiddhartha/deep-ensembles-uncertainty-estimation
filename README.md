### Implementation of [Simple and Scalable Predictive Uncertainty Estimation using Deep Ensembles](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7219-simple-and-scalable-predictive-uncertainty-estimation-using-deep-ensembles.pdf)

* Can be executed from either downloading the repo from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Nykz8Fjh9Xe24SADO7fmprnm-Gl2Qffh) or running this [Colab notebook]()
* Open "Complete pipeline.ipynb" (this notebook) for run-through on Fig 3a & 6 (other files include testing files and modules)
* Information on data (MNIST, notMNIST) in the data folder (info.txt)
* Logic flow can be viewed by looking at the notebooks in the /test directory; the Complete Pipeline notebook is a cleaned up run-through for experiment visualization
* Implemented on locally then uploaded to Google Colab
